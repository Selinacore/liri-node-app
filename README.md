# liri-node-app

# Welcome to LiriBot! <h1>
## In this application you can give node certain paramaters that will return a list of either, concerts for a specific band, song for a specific artist, movie information for almost any movie, and also a litle bit of random! <h2>

### To get concert info: run node liri.js concert-this "name of band/artist"<h3>
### To get song info: run node liri.js spoptify-this-song "name of a song"<h3>
### To get movie info: run node liri.js movie-this "title of movie"<h3>
### To get something a little bit random or surprise data: run node liri.js do-what-it-says<h3>

#### Here is a litle video of how it works! <h4>
